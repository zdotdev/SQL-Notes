SQL employs a number of standard command keywords that are integral to interact with databases. Keywords in SQL provide instructions as to what action should be performed.

Here are some of the primary SQL keywords:

**SELECT**: This keyword retrieves data from a database. For example,

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

In the above statement `*` indicates that all records should be retrieved from the `Customers` table.

**FROM**: Used in conjunction with `SELECT` to specify the table from which to fetch data.

**WHERE**: Used to filter records. Incorporating a WHERE clause, you might specify conditions that must be met. For example,

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='Germany';
```

**INSERT INTO**: This command is used to insert new data into a database.

```SQL
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal','Tom B. Erichsen','Skagen 21','Stavanger','4006','Norway');
```

**UPDATE**: This keyword updates existing data within a table. For example,

```SQL
UPDATE Customers SET ContactName='Alfred Schmidt', City='Frankfurt' WHERE CustomerID=1;
```

**DELETE**: This command removes one or more records from a table. For example,

```SQL
DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';
```

**CREATE DATABASE**: As implied by its name, this keyword creates a new database.

```SQL
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
```

**ALTER DATABASE**, **DROP DATABASE**, **CREATE TABLE**, **ALTER TABLE**, **DROP TABLE**: These keywords are used to modify databases and tables.

Remember that SQL is not case sensitive, meaning keywords can be written in lower case. The convention is to write them in ALL CAPS for readability. There are many more keywords in SQL, but these are some of the most common.

- `SELECT` - extracts data from a database
- `UPDATE` - updates data in a database
- `DELETE` - deletes data from a database
- `INSERT INTO` - inserts new data into a database
- `CREATE DATABASE` - creates a new database
- `ALTER DATABASE` - modifies a database
- `CREATE TABLE` - creates a new table
- `ALTER TABLE` - modifies a table
- `DROP TABLE` - deletes a table
- `CREATE INDEX` - creates an index (search key)
- `DROP INDEX` - deletes an index

# SQL Select Statement
The `SELECT` statement is used to select data from a database.

**Example:** 
```sql
SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;
```

## Syntax
```sql
SELECT _column1_, _column2, ..._  
FROM _table_name_;
```
Here, column1, column2, ... are the _field names_ of the table you want to select data from. The table_name represents the name of the _table_ you want to select data from.

# SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement
The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.(remove duplication)

**Example:**
Select all the different countries from the "Customers" table:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;
```
Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.

## Syntax
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT _column1_, _column2, ..._  
FROM _table_name_;
```
